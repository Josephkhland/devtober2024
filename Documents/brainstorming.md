# Streaming Log Brainstorming

## My Veto List
> 3D Styles (The game we are making shall be a 2D game so that I can draw all the assets during stream time). 

## Features
> Plant Seeds , Wait and Harvest.

## Idea
> Just make random features as it goes, suggested by the viewers and followers. 
> Harvest Hell 2 - Start with a few plants, plant them to beat your enemies as you progress through levels and perhaps a story.
> Vampires Survivors direction -> Try to survive a bunch o enemies in an open world infinite plane & You use the harvest to create new weapons and powerups.
